# Module 5: Logic and Control Flow  
## Lesson 01.01: Introduction

## üß† Step 1: Explore the Topic

### What is Logic in JavaScript?
Logic allows a program to make decisions based on conditions. These are expressed using:
- Boolean values (`true`/`false`)
- Comparison operators (`===`, `!==`, `>`, `<`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

### What is Control Flow?
Control flow determines the order in which code runs. JavaScript executes code top to bottom, but logic structures like:
- `if/else`
- `switch`
- `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops  
...allow conditional branching and repetition.

### Why It Matters
Logic and control flow make code dynamic, responsive, and adaptable. They are foundational for features like:
- Form validation
- User input handling
- Loops through data
- Game logic and state control

### üõí Online Shopping Checkout
If the cart total is over $50, free shipping is applied. Otherwise, a $5 fee is charged.
```javascript
if (cartTotal > 50) {
  shippingCost = 0;
} else {
  shippingCost = 5;
}
```

### üö¶ Traffic Light System
Respond to traffic light color using conditions.
```javascript
if (lightColor === 'green') {
  action = 'go';
} else if (lightColor === 'yellow') {
  action = 'slow down';
} else {
  action = 'stop';
}
```

### üì± Phone Unlock
Grant access or show an error based on password match.
```javascript

  unlockPhone();
} else {
  displayError();
}
```
