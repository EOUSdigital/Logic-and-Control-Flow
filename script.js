//TODO üìó Module 5. Logic and Control Flow - Lesson 01.01: Introduction


//TODO  üìù Step 1: Section Intro

//* Step 1: Explore the Topic
//  Logic and Control Flow are fundamental building blocks in programming. They allow a program to make decisions, repeat actions, and react to changing data and conditions‚Äîjust like how people make choices or follow instructions in everyday life.

//? üîπ What Is Logic in JavaScript?
//  Logic refers to decision-making in your code. It determines what code should run based on specific conditions.
//  ‚Ä¢ Used in: if, else, switch, ternary operators
//  ‚Ä¢ Built on: Boolean values (true or false), logical operators (&&, ||, !), and comparison operators (==, ===, >, <, etc.)

//? üîπ What Is Control Flow?
//  Control flow is the order in which code is executed.
//  JavaScript executes code top to bottom, but:
//  ‚Ä¢ Conditional statements (e.g., if, else) can skip parts.
//  ‚Ä¢ Loops (e.g., for, while) can repeat parts.
//  ‚Ä¢ Functions and early returns can change the flow.

//? üîπ Why It Matters
//  Without logic and control flow:
//  ‚Ä¢ Programs run the same way every time.
//  ‚Ä¢ There is no decision-making ability.
//  ‚Ä¢ We cannot respond to user input, handle data changes, or build interactive applications.

//? üîπ Where It is Used
//  ‚Ä¢ Form validation (e.g., ‚ÄúIs this email valid?‚Äù)
//  ‚Ä¢ Feature toggles (e.g., dark mode on/off)
//  ‚Ä¢ Repeating actions (e.g., show items in a list)
//  ‚Ä¢ User authentication (‚ÄúIs the password correct?‚Äù)
//  ‚Ä¢ Games, animations, error handling, data processing, etc.

//? üîπ Limits
//  ‚Ä¢ Logic errors can break flow or lead to unintended behavior.
//  ‚Ä¢ Too many nested conditions reduce readability.
//  ‚Ä¢ Poorly controlled loops can cause infinite execution.
//  ‚Ä¢ Must be used intentionally with clarity and purpose.


//TODO  üìù Step 2: Real-World Examples
//  To make logic and control flow more relatable, let‚Äôs look at how similar thinking happens in real life. JavaScript uses the same decision-making process we use every day‚Äîjust expressed in code.

//* üõí Online Shopping Checkout
//  Scenario: We are checking out at an online store.
//  ‚Ä¢ Logic:
//      ‚Üí If your cart total is over $50, you get free shipping.
//      ‚Üí If not, you pay $5 for shipping.
//  ‚Ä¢ Control Flow:
//      ‚Üí JavaScript checks your total.
//      ‚Üí Then decides which message and fee to show you.

//? Code Analogy:

if (cartTotal >= 50) {
    shippingCost = 0;
} else {
    shippingCost = 5;
}

//* üö¶ Traffic Light System
//  Scenario: A traffic light changes color based on a timer.
//  ‚Ä¢ Logic:
//      ‚Üí If it is red, cars must stop.
//      ‚Üí If it is green, cars can go.
//      ‚Üí If it is yellow, cars must slow down.
//  ‚Ä¢ Control Flow:
//      ‚Üí The program checks the color and decides what instruction to give.

//? Code Analogy:

if (lightColor === 'green') {
    action = 'go';
} else if (lightColor === 'yellow') {
    action = 'slow down';
} else {
    action = 'stop';
}

//* üì± Phone Unlock
//  Scenario: Unlocking your phone.
//  ‚Ä¢ Logic:
//      ‚Üí If the entered password is correct ‚Üí grant access.
//      ‚Üí If not ‚Üí show error.
//  ‚Ä¢ Control Flow:
//      ‚Üí Based on your input, the phone either proceeds to the home screen or displays an error message.

//? Code Analogy:

if (enteredPassword === correctPassword) {
    unlockPhone();
} else {
    displayError();
}

//* üéØ Fitness App Step Goal
//  Scenario: A fitness tracker updates based on user steps.
//  ‚Ä¢ Logic:
//      ‚Üí If you reach 10,000 steps, display a success badge.
//      ‚Üí Otherwise, show how many steps are left.
//  ‚Ä¢ Control Flow:
//      ‚Üí The app continuously checks your step count and adjusts the display.

//? Code Analogy:

if (steps >= 10000) {
    showBadge();
} else {
    showRemainingSteps(10000 - steps);
}

//! ‚ú® Summary
//  These examples show how logic and control flow are used:
//  ‚Ä¢ To evaluate conditions
//  ‚Ä¢ To decide outcomes
//  ‚Ä¢ To respond dynamically to input or data
//  Just like our make decisions based on rules or information in real life, so does your code‚Äîstep by step.
